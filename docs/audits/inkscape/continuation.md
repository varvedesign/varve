# Continuation record

Last updated: 2026-10-18.

## Goal and scope

Review the Inkscape issue corpus and recursively investigate relevant evidence
to make verified improvements in Varve. The target is Inkscape's main vector
editor issue tracker (`gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape`). User correction on
2026-10-18 confirms Inkscape as the intended target despite inconsistent
project wording elsewhere in the attached brief. Keep the baseline on
Inkscape’s canonical tracker.

## Cutoffs

- Cutoff A creation timestamp: `2026-10-17T10:03:35Z`.
- Initial GitLab API count and crawl: 6,390 issues (2,112 opened; 4,278
  closed). Durable rehydration exposed two accessible issues with pre-cutoff
  creation dates (#6482 and #6483) absent from that paginated snapshot. The
  ledger is expanding to include both; corrected baseline target: 6,392 IIDs.
- Full list/body crawl: completed across 64 pages from `2026-10-17T10:05:41Z`
  through `2026-10-17T10:08:41Z` UTC. Page 64 had 90 rows; all page totals
  reported 6,390. Creation dates spanned 2018-11-19 through 2026-10-16.
- Original raw cache `/tmp/inkscape-corpus-2026-10-17/` is no longer present.
  Its combined issue NDJSON SHA-256 was
  `f1e9f6be7cc3eaa8a7381b510bf89cad23858717e84dd6468126d81a80720d43`.
  Rehydrate source responses under
  `~/.cache/varve/inkscape-corpus-2026-10-17/` with
  `python3 scripts/research/inkscape/fetch_issues.py`; this preserves the
  frozen ledger ID set and records later issues separately.
- List records report 32,680 notes across 5,667 issues. Discussion notes
  are being re-fetched through GitLab GraphQL `Issue.notes` connections. The
  previous temporary cache snapshot at `2026-10-17T10:24:25Z` recorded 921
  issue threads and 14,364 total note records (6,216 non-system comments), but
  that cache is gone and those records are historical counts only. Durable-cache retrieval is active; at `2026-10-18T11:46:06Z` it had reconciled
  3,633 of 32,692 non-system comments across 319 issue threads. The live manifest
  is authoritative between checkpoints. The fetcher is resumable and
  persists notes per IID in the external cache. Seven aliases per request
  succeeded below the observed complexity limit; eight scored 201 and failed
  the API's 200 ceiling. `user_notes_count` counts non-system comments; the
  GraphQL connection also returns system notes.
- Cutoff B: pending; take only after completing the baseline engineering pass,
  then record later arrivals separately.

## Repository/worktree

- Varve repository: `varvedesign/varve`; actual remote still points at the
  previous `K-Arthur/varve` URL, which GitHub resolves to the current project.
- Task worktree: `.worktrees/inkscape-corpus`, branch `feat/inkscape-corpus`,
  created from local `master` at `0241f1a63`.
- Local `master` is 143 commits ahead and 7 behind `origin/master`, with
  extensive uncommitted work owned by other sessions. Do not alter, stage, or
  commit that work. No remote integration or deployment has occurred.
- Do not stop other agents, their browser/app sessions, or their validation
  processes. The earlier queued browser run was this agent's own and was
  cancelled before acquiring the shared heavy-task lease.

## Completed

1. Read the supplied brief and project instructions.
2. Corrected source identity: GitHub mirror has no issues; official tracker is
   GitLab. Confirmed the tracker with GitLab's public API and reconciled the
   open/closed totals at cutoff setup.
3. Created this isolated worktree and source-boundary record.
4. Durable rehydration recovered all 64 issue-list pages and 6,392 unique
   baseline bodies, with zero missing or duplicate baseline IDs. It exposed
   two pre-cutoff items omitted by the initial crawl; #6482 and #6483 are now
   included in the ledger. The initial 6,390-row count and checksum remain
   historical.
5. Built a one-row-per-issue ledger with source metadata and explicit pending
   screening, thread, evidence, engineering and visual status. Added resumable
   issue-body and GraphQL discussion fetchers.
6. Screened issue bodies #6398 (save-time memory growth), #6380 (PDF text loss),
   #6477 (extension path rewriting) and linked #1313. Varve uses embedded,
   content-addressed image assets and strips repeated per-fill payloads, so
   #6398 is only an adjacent memory-risk hypothesis pending measurement. The
   #6380 PDF attachment returned HTTP 403; #6398's attached archive warns it
   can lock up the system and was not downloaded or executed.
7. Screened body #2800, a second historical Inkscape report of memory retained
   per save with a linked PNG. The reported archive was not downloaded. Current
   body-screening total is 6 of 6,392; threads and linked fix history for these
   candidates remain pending.

## Next operation

Continue reconciling the 6,392-issue ledger and all 32,692 reported non-system
comments, then screen the remaining bodies and discussions. Continue screening issue bodies and
discussions for high-impact candidate failure classes. Keep system notes for
linked events and state history. Do not mark an issue reviewed based only on
its title, labels, or downloaded body.
